## About This Project

_RippleGen_ is a interactive website that runs an animated simulation of the various wave phenomena:
- __Standing wave generation__
- __Wave interference__
- __Wave transmission between two different media__

This project was developed as a visualization tool for students. Its key feature are the simulation parameters that can adjusted while it runs. Some of these parameters include:

- control of the frequency, amplitude, and phase of up to 2 input waves
- control of reflection and damping effects
- control of simulation speed, which allows the user to slow things down for a better look
