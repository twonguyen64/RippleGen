<p><b>A standing wave</b> is a special interference pattern formed when two identical waves travel towards each other and interfere. 
A common occurrence of this is when a wave encounters a boundary and is reflected back (demonstrated in this simulation).</p>
<p>Although one source generated this wave, we now have two traveling waves: one outgoing and one reflected. 
You&#39;ll notice when these waves superimpose each other, two areas of particular interest are generated:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">Areas where destructive interference is at a maximum (called <strong>nodes</strong>). The two waves are completely out of phase at this location, and the resultant amplitude from adding the waves together here is always zero.</li>
<li>Areas where constructive interference is at a maximum (called <strong>antinodes</strong>). The waves are completely in phase here, so that resultant amplitude becomes twice the original amplitude.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, the generation of nodes &amp; antinodes is a result of the interfering waves being identical. The resultant wave appears stationary, hence, <strong>&quot;standing&quot;</strong>.</p>

<p>A <strong>harmonic</strong> is one of several possible standing wave patterns for a given system (where the system can be a string, windpipe, etc.). The shape of the pattern and the number of nodes depends on the length of the system \(L\) and the type of boundaries at the ends:</p>

$$\begin{align}
\text{Both fixed / both free ends:}\qquad &amp;L = n \frac{\lambda}{2},\quad n = 1,2,3\dots\\\\
\text{One fixed & one free end:}\qquad &amp;L = n \frac{\lambda}{4}, \quad n = 1,3,5\dots
\end{align}
$$
<p>Where \(\lambda\) is the wavelength, and \(n\)  denotes all the possible harmonics (1st harmonic, 2nd harmonic, etc.)</p>

<h3 id="simulation-example">Simulation Example</h3>
<ul>
<li>Set the <em>Frequency</em> to <strong>8Hz</strong> and <em>Pulse Width</em> to <strong>1λ</strong>.</li>
<li>Set both <em>Right &amp; Left side reflections</em> to <strong>Fixed End</strong>.</li>
<li>Make sure that <em>Properties</em> sliders are set to <strong>No damping</strong> and <strong>Full reflection</strong></li>
<li>Decrease to length of the medium to <strong>1λ</strong> by dragging the <em>boundary slider</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now try <strong>sending a single pulse</strong>. Notice how the resultant wave is reflected and interferes with itself. 
Since \(L = \lambda\), that means \(n = 2\) and we are generating the <strong>2nd harmonic</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to see the pattern properly, send a new pulse with a <em>Pulse Width</em> of <strong>2λ</strong>. The 2nd harmonic standing wave should be a lot clearer now.</p>
<p>Now try sending a continuous wave (click <strong>SEND WAVE</strong> instead of <strong>SEND PULSE</strong>). Notice how the resultant wave gains more and more energy out of each consecutive reflection. This is because we are simulating with ideal conditions which aren&#39;t present in real life. In practice, waves will lose energy as they travel across space (<strong>damping</strong>) and will lose energy after each reflection (<strong>absorption by the boundary</strong>).</p>
